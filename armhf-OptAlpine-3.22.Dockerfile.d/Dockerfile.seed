# This docker file generates a modified Alpine Linux.
#
# The most important (dirty hack!) patch is moving the libary search path to /opt/alpine/lib,
# so we relocate coliding libraries from Alpines Userland.
#
# Aftwards it dumps specific binaries and packages to tarballs, that can
# later be extracted without conflicts to the Userland of Xiegu or R1CBU
# assuming that we add only software that is not present in the original
# image.
